            As can be seen, github is a essential platform which will take part in our future careers, especialy with web developers. <br> 
            Understanding the need of everybody, it is my pleasure to show you how to install and use git hub. <br> 
            Hope you enjoy this tutorial .

            <p class="VCS">To give you more material for a better insight into this system, I will provide you with an explanation about how the so-called Version Control System works.<br>
            Version Control System - VCS will manage and store all the files of the entire project and also the modifying history of each file.<br> 
            With each modification, a version will be created .<br> 
            The system will help developers to clone and store different versions of source code from the repository, <br>
            each change of source code from local devices will be committed and posted to the server where the repository is located .

            <p class="VCS">it is a Distributed Version Control System - DVCS, arguably, it is one of the most commonly used systems today. <br>
            Git provides each developer with a separated repository, containing a complete history of changes.

            <h1  class="headingVCS">How does Git work ?</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="divMeth">
            <p class="VCS">Basically, version control systems like CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, etc. all share a common behavior, which is to view the information they store as a collection of files and their changes over time. <br>
            To be clear, eventhough the latest version has no modification, VCS still store it as the latest version. <br>  
            However, Git does not work according to the above principles, instead, Git saves its information as snapshots. <br>
            Every time you delegate, Git creates a snapshot with a reference to it. For maximum efficiency, Git will not archive if the file is committed but without any changes. <br>
            The image below will provide a better vivid imagination.
