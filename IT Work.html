Their responsibilities also include collecting requests from users, defining system functions, and writing code . Throughout his time working in the workplace, the people he came into contact with were all colleagues in the same industry, to be specific were the interns . Besides, after work, his habit is to play basketball with his friends . Much of his time was spent at work, and more specifically, it was spent coding at his place . He just left when there was something required . Relied on my personal experiences, updating knowledge about the lastest development is an combulsory and necessary for any area of IT industry, however, the most challenging aspect is poor management .</p>

Most of the interactions he had was with his colleagues and teammates in the same project . Most of his time was spent at office especially at his place . With today's technology, most user and public-private organizations' data are transferred and stored over cyberspace, which has prompted an increase in hackers seeing them as targets for mining . Therefore, the work of cybersecurity professionals requires them to continually find security vulnerabilities and measures to increase the protection of such data against increasingly sophisticated attacks by hackers.</p>

                                        <p>Discuss : In general, the job of a DevOps engineer includes programming, product development, and product operation, so a developer in the DevOps position requires programming knowledge, programming skills as well as knowledge of system administration and operation . Almost interactions in the videos were between DevOps Engineering specialist and his co-workers at workplace . Most of the time during his working hours, he sat at his personal desk at the office to do his tasks such as checking email, chat, dashboard, daily standup meeting and coding . The biggest challenge is the management's ability . DevOps engineer can be considered as the person who connects the develop and operate phases, so the flow of information that is not properly communicated will lead to the project not being properly implemented .</p>
