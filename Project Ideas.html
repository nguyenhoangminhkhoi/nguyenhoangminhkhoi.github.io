                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>As for the idea for a future project, I would like to choose the idea of developing an application on the mobile phone.
                    In terms of ideas, I am considering in developing an application that allows users to learn about foods, such as their origins, nutritional value, types and how to prepare them by means of combined with other foods.
                    In addition, users can provide health parameters, as well as data about their interests and daily routines so that they can get feedback on aspects which are needed to improve or develop.
                    Moreover, by relying on these data, the application will also provide users with a reasonable diet, as well as plan each meal for a week or a special occasion.</p>
            
                    <h3>Motivation</h3>
                    <p>Unlike the old days, when food at that period was only for the purpose of satisfying the instinct: providing energy for daily routine.
                    Nowadays, there is a significant shift in human demand for foods, from eating to fullness, they now focus on many aspects of victual, from flavor, to nutritional and cultural values in every dish.<br>  
                    As of January 2020, according to statistics released by vnetwork.vn, the connected mobile devices and Internet usage are 150 percent and 70 percent respectively.
                    In addition, up to 62 percent of respondents said that they are interested in cooking and enjoying food at home.
                    They also shared that they started to form this habit since the outbreak of the Covid pandemic.
                    Through the above figures, we can see that the demand for home cooking is on the rise, and it is not difficult to see that the demand for recipes will be growth as well.</p>
         
                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>In term of features, as I have outlined them in the overview, in this description, these features and their functions will be described in the most detailed.
                    This application I refered to as NN, represents Necessary Nutrition, which will have five primary features, including Food Type, Diet Introduction, Create Recipe and finally is Complete Menu</p>
    
                    <h3>Food Type</h3>
                    <p>The first feature that I want to introduce is Food Type, as the name suggests, this feature has the function of describing the food that the user is looking for, the description will include the food group, origins, growth's environments and duration, composition and nutritional value of the food.
                    In addition, the application also provides users with primary notes when selecting and consuming, methods of processing and preservation are also provided to specific type of food.
                    For example, when a user searches for the keyword "pork", it will be classified as 'protein', of Vietnamese origin, etc.
                    As can be seen, this feature not only provides basic knowledge about "pork" such as how to distinguish clean meat, preserving and cooking method, it also provides users with a certain amount of intensive knowledge for those with searching demand.</p>
       
                    <h3>Diet Introduction</h3>
                    <p>According to the statistics provided by statista.com, currently in urban, there are 80 percent of men and 73 percent of women stated that they are interested in exercising with different purposes.
                    In a similar way, the health section at thanhnien.vn also had an article about the increase in sport demand of Vietnamese people reflected in 76 million searches via google and at the same time, the number of membership registrations at California Fitness & Yoga reached a record high of more than 25 percent per month in second quarter in 2020.
                    This shows that the need for health as well as fitness has become an essential part of daily life . As the result, the selection of foods and dishes suitable for the training regime of each user is also a top concern.
                    So, by entering the health informations of each individual, as well as the exercise regimen, the Diet Introduction feature will offer the most reasonable diet based on these informations . However, these diet plan are not required, users can refer through that to create a specific diet for themselves.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Create Recipe</h3>
                    <p>This feature will give users the ability to choose or create a recipe based on selected ingredients, the application will give suggestions about recipes that the users can refer to.
                    In my opinion, this is quite an interesting feature, as users can take advantage of the available ingredients for cooking.
                    It is especially useful if the users are office workers, students or even housewives who want to cook by themselves without having to spend time thinking about what they will cook, as well as spending time shopping necessary stuffs, they just have to choose available ingredients, and recipes will be designed automatically, relating to those ingredients.
                    Moreover, they can also choose their own cooking style such as frying, stir-frying, boiled, stewed, etc. or if they are hobbyists of cooking, they can also create their own recipes and share them with other users.</p>

                    <h3>Complete Menu</h3>
                    <p>This is the ulltimate feature in my application as well as the greatest feature in my personal perspective.
                     Home cooking demand is now not only for housewives, but also for office workers and students . It helps reducing living costs, as well as ensure the quality of each meal . However, with a dence schedule, it will be a challenge for them to to choose what to eat for each meal, leading to the situation of eating out or fill an empty stomach with instant noodles.
                     In the short term, eating out will cause financial problems, especially for students with difficult circumstances, in the long term, there will be negative effects on health due to inadequate dietary intake.<br>
                    Because of that, the idea for creating a menu function for the whole week was created . My idea of this feature is: Users will choose how often they want to go on the menu, the number of people and the number of dishes for each meal . For instance, the timeline is five days, four people and three dishes per meal, the app will immediately plan meals for five days with three courses including main courses, soups and side dishes for four people . After entering data, a list of ingredients and quantities of each will be created and users can start shopping based on the given list and finally, on the last day of duration, the menu will be replaced.<br>
                    In addition, this feature will also be useful in case users want to organize a party, the progress will have three steps involved : 1. Select a specific date, 2. Enter the number of guests and 3. Choose the number of dishes, the application will suggest them a complete menu based on these informations, or they can choose the dishes that suit their preferences, after that, application will suggest a list of ingredients with the necessary quantity for the party.  
                    </p>
                    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
                    <p>I When creating an application, in my opinion, the most important part is the data of the application as well as the user. Therefore, my top priority is to create a database to store a huge amount of the above data, and MySQL is my primary decision . [5] MySQL is a  RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) software with open source code, which means that programmers can easily manipulate its source code according to their preferences, so it is currently one of the the most popular software and only behind Oracle Database. The reason MySQL is so popular is its flexibility and ease of use .<br>
                    Next is the familiar software VSC (Visual Studio Code) is definitely a familiar software for programmers, so I would like to skip the explanation of what VSC is and go straight to the explanation. reason. The reason for this choice is because VSC can support multi-language, cross-platform programming, as well as Git support.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Skill Required</h3>
                    <p>Programming language: The programming languages required to implement the above project include two for each part, backend and frontend respectively. First is PHP, which is a backend programming language popular among developers, specializing in web and application programming . For the frontend, JavaScript is my choice, the strength of this language is that it can support cross-platform, and able to program on both Android and iOS. <br>
                    API: As the matter of fact, one thing that is indispensable when developing an application is the API . This is the protocol that acts as an intermediary for the connection between users and databases.<br>
                    All the necessary requirements to implement the project can be easily searched and used, thanks to the abundant information and knowledge coming from the Internet, so the current difficulty for me is  the proficiency in programming and programming knowledge .</p>
                    <h3>Outcome</h3>
                    <p>In the event that this project is successful, it will satisfy the need for home cooking habits, as well as the need for a suitable diet for each individual's condition. This also brings significant benefits to individuals or organizations that supply clean ingredients to consumers.<br>
                    In addition, the problem of food waste will be partially resolved when the quantity of ingredients to be purchased is calculated as reasonably as possible. The positive effects it brings will include: Changing, adjusting eating habits for each individual, forming cooking habits and enjoying food at home, providing knowledge about food groups and the nutritional value they bring, and ultimately, minimizing food waste.</p>
