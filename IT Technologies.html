                    <h3>What is the state of the art of Cloud Computing? </h3>
                    <p>The world is seeing an explosion, as well as the versatility of Cloud Computing . By its versatility, Cloud Computing has been and will be applied in many aspect around our life.<br>
                    According to an article reported by Salman Saleem, cloud computing technology is on the rise . In October 2019, the launch of Quantum breakthroughs from Google marked an evolutionary milestone for cloud computing, with the announcement from Google that they would achieve achievements far beyond the capabilities of an usual computer . The article also said that quantum computers bring great meaning to many fields, especially AI (Artifical Intelligence) . Google device are able to perform a mathematical  calculation within 3 minutes and a half, while it will take a modern supercomputer 10,000 years to do the same thing . <br>
                    Stadia, a cloud gaming service, was launched by Google on November 19, 2019. This is a service that allows users to play and stream AAA games online without requiring them to invest in expensive gear.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What can Cloud Computing be done now?</h3>
                    <p>The first point that can be mentioned is Marketing segment. As before, the necessary data for marketing includes advertising campaign, strategy and number of interactions , etc. All are separately collected and reported. This takes marketers time to analyze and connect these data to create a complete picture of future plans . Now, with the help of platforms such as HubSpot, Adope Marketing Cloud, information will automatically be collected, categorized and connected together to create and implement future marketing plans . <br>
                    Next is the application in education . Presentation would not be as beneficial without the powerful support from Microsoft Powerpoint . However, the limitations it brings like cost, and Powerpoint is not available on all computers, so online services like SlideRocket.com and Google Slide are the best alternatives to solve the problem above . Moreover, after the Covid epidemic broke out, going to school and classes was impossible, the solution for this problem, Online classes are now a great alternative with support from applications like Zoom or Discord . <br>
                    Finally, it's the application to medicine and health . Hospital records are known for their enormous numbers and dense, in order to find the best treatment, doctors have to look through a large number of patient records . Not only does this take time, but the possibility of having mistakes does exist . Therefore, Cloud Computing has provided the healthcare industry a more efficient way when it is possible to access patient medical records stored in virtual database . Moreover is the ability to heal remotely when the world records a surgery that was performed thousands of miles away in China, January 2019 . </p>

                    <h3>What is Cloud Computing to be able to be done soon in the next 3 year ? </h3>
                    <p>First, according to some experts' predictions, within the next three years, most of the work will be shifted to cloud-generated services. This is being done as now 80 percent of businesses are using office's gadgets from Google and Microsoft like Google Workplace from Google and Microsoft 365 from Microsoft.<br>
                    According to Salman Saleem, statisticians at IDC have observed that in the next few years, 75 percent of the amount of data will be done and computed outside of regular databases, and there will be more than 40 percent of The company launches cloud technology with edge algorithms as the foundation. They also say that by 2022, end-point devices will be able to run AI algorithms. </p>
    
                    <h3>What technological or other make this possible? </h3>
                    The above predictions can only be made if the problems of the bandwidth and the transmition speed of the network are solved .  <br>
                    <p>However, recently with the explosion of 5G infrastructure, devices like smartphones and computers will only play the role of displaying information, processing and storage will be transmitted to the cloud by 5G network . It can be seen that the emergence of 5G network has played an important role in the development of cloud computing, contributing to promoting the development of the technology from now on .</p>    

                    <h3>What is the potential impact of Cloud Computing? </h3>
                    <p>As mentioned above, the development potential of Cloud Computing is still being explored and exploited, but the potential potential of Cloud Computing has been shown through its high applicability when it can be applied in many aspects of life . Its potential will help us solve part of the problem of a slowdown in hardware development, typically electronic chips and device memory .</p>
                    
                    <h3>What is likely to change?</h3>
                    <p>Currently, the whole world is witnessing a change in the way of living and working of each people . As can be seen, the majority of companies and schools around the world have switched to working from home under the influence of Covid 19, personally I think this change is justified and needs to be maintained for the benefits it brings . Working remotely does not require a workspace for a company, which will reduce costs such as electricity, water and space fees, similar to education and healthcare . Moreover, productivity as well as efficiency in work and study are enhanced by the ability to access and store large amounts of information and knowledge needed.</p>

                    <h3>Which people will be most affected and how?</h3>
                    <p>Anyone can be directly and indirectly influenced by the development of Cloud Computing, but most notably are organizations.<br>
                    Now, the adoption of Cloud Computing in business operations is no longer an option but has become a combulsory requirement . It represents the success of a business, especially during the startup phase. The benefits can be mentioned are the cost and efficiency of the work.<br>
                    In terms of cost benefits, most startups have the same problem: Low budget, so instead of spending a large amount of money in investing in modern equipment, they can choose the online services for office  mentioned above for the alternative, this is an optimal solution for these businesses to save costs .<br>
                    The efficiency side is also mentioned above, the tools for marketing will gradually become familiar to marketers, helping them achieve high efficiency and the time to profit will be sooner if compared with the past, the same goes for hone in on work skills.<br>
                    From the two above factors, the organization will quickly accumulate budget, and thereby meet the needs of equipment and manpower to invest in the company's strategy.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h3>
                    <p>The development of Cloud computing has brought about changes in the global labor market, especially in the IT industry.<br>
                    System Administrators and Database Administrators are at risk of decline, mainly attributed to remote manipulation and storage by cloud computing, so these internal position won't really be needed .<br>
                    HelpDesk and System support: these are two jobs that are supposed to decrease, as hardware requirements are no longer so important . However, they are expected to increase in companies that provide cloud services.<br>
                    Meanwhile, the careers with a bright future include: <br>
                    Project managers with IT experience: The reason cloud computing companies employ IT project managers is to operate data systems. <br>
                    Business analyst: Personnel in this field will continue to be valuable in both in-house and remote providers. <br>
                    Cloud providers: The need to maintain, build and adapt software systems of businesses will contribute to the robust growth of cloud providers. <br>
                    Software developer: This field will also continue to grow because of the high demand of the market. Software will always need to be updated, maintained and created</p>
                
                    <h3>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</h3>
                    <p>It can be said that cloud computing has completely changed my daily life . Several years ago,  unknowing the benefits that it brings, I often encounter some problems in the learning process, and in life, we can list them as follows: </p>
                    <p>-The first problem is the lack of software for editing, presentations, and computation . However, knowing about the add-ons provided by Google, this issue has been completely resolved.<br>
                    -The second problem is the storage space, about three years ago when there were data that need to be stored, I always had to spend hours picking out unnecessary data to delete . Therefore, when it comes to Google Drive or OneDrive, the problem has been resolved when I can store a large amount of data and access them easily when they are needed .<br>
                    -The second problem is data transfer . Data transmission between devices in the past requires the support of a USB, now I can easily access them as long as I have an Internet connection . Moreover, I can easily share them with partners via a direct link. <br>
                    -The last problem is the storage space, about three years ago when there were data that need to be stored, I always had to spend hours picking out unnecessary data to delete . Therefore, when it comes to Google Drive or OneDrive, the problem has been resolved when I can store a large amount of data and access them easily when they are needed .</p>

                    <h3>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h3>
                    <p>For my family, the impact of this technology is not very prominent but does not completely deny its convenience . The data to remember is now stored in the cloud, so having to waste time searching for the notes when needed is no longer a problem. <br>
                    In the case of my friends, sharing data has never been easier. It is especially useful when it is time to do group exercises, people do not need to gather together to keep up with the latest changes.</p>
